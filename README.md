# About
This Android application is used to test Tensorflow/Pytorch graphs. This is a almost all in one kind of application for image related tasks or atleast it will be and soon more tasks will be added gradually. The soul purpose is to test inference graphs on android for variety of tasks fast and easily. Also one can use it to learn how the code works for pytorch and tensorflow. I don't own any code, I've just joined pieces made by the community on Tensorflow/Pytorch, so feel free to make changes.

# Features
- Fast inference on android for tensorflow/pytorch graphs.
- Supports Classification, Object Detection.
- Small size and easy to understand code.
- Open source: Edit/Make changes, use as a starter template No Worries.
- Open to Contribution just request.
