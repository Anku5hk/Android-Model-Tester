# About
This Android application is used to test Tensorflow/Pytorch graphs. This is a almost all in one kind of application for image related tasks or atleast it will be and soon more tasks will be added gradually. The soul purpose is to test inference graphs on android for variety of tasks fast and easily. Also one can use it to learn how the code works for pytorch and tensorflow. I don't own most code, only made it look simple, it follows official documentation on Tensorflow/Pytorch websites, so feel free to make changes.

# Features
- Fast inference on android for tensorflow/pytorch graphs.
- Supports Classification, Object Detection.
- Auto detect library(Tensorflow/Pytorch).
- Small size and easy to understand code(Tons of comments).
- Open source: Edit/Make changes, use as a starter template No Worries.
- Open to Contribution just request.

# How To?
1. Train your model.
2. Save it as .pt for pytorch or .tflite for tensorflow.
3. Put labels(classes names) into a simple .txt file, no formatting needed only newline for new class. 
   Same for object detection.
4. Select files through aplication setting.
5. Select image and press button.
6. Done.

# More Features to be added(Maybe)
- More Image tasks.
- Multi Output classification.
- Maybe Text tasks.
- Use of Multi Thread.
